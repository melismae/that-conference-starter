# THAT Conference Demo App

This code accompanies "Breaking Up To Make Up: The UI Component Library Journey" presentation for [THAT Conference](https://www.thatconference.com/), August 6-8, 2018.[Presentation can be found here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pjzwZC6jQnxb5iSv5uPhEnlWAk97vt_BGT441JEivmU/edit?usp=sharing)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It uses styled-components and font-awesome icons, and builds out components from [Akash Tyagi's Atomize UI Design System's free sample](https://gumroad.com/l/atomize).

It also allows users to see a couple components in three different UI Component Libraries to demonstrate basics of how to set up and use: [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), [React Cosmos](https://react-cosmos.github.io/), and [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/).

## Scripts

To start the app run `npm start`. If you fork and want to try out other things, check out the Create React App link above. (Should be running locally on port 3000).

To start storybook, run `npm run storybook`. Storybook will run in port 9009.

To start Cosmos, run `npm run cosmos`. Cosmos will run in port 8989.

To start Styleguidist, with an `npx` supported version of Node, run `npx styleguidist server`.
